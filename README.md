# Puzzle-Webapp
I have developed a brainstorming puzzle web app which involves creating an interactive platform that engages users in solving puzzles and generating ideas. 
The app typically presents users with a variety of puzzles, such as word puzzles or visual puzzles, that require creative and analytical thinking to solve. 
The app may also include features such as hints, and scoring systems to increase user engagement.
